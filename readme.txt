The program consists of main.py and the class definitions that are used within,
Square.py, WordPlacer.py, Board.py

Running instructions
1. In order to show the board in command line, I used the library tabulate.
So, please run "python -m pip install tabulate" first.
2. You may then run the program by executing "python main.py"
