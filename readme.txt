IMPORTANT NOTE: Program does contain some logical errors, so if the sequence of tried words
is randomized, it doesn't produce an output sometimes. I couldn't fix this in time, and I could
hack around this by providing a pre-determined sequence of checks rather than making it randomized,
so that "I would know" that the program would work regardless, but I decided against it.

So program might not give the solution 30% of the time, please re-run multiple times and 
you will see the solution in one of the executions.

The program consists of main.py and the class definitions that are used within,
Square.py, WordPlacer.py, Board.py

Running instructions
1. In order to show the board in command line, I used the library tabulate.
So, please run "python -m pip install tabulate" first.
2. You may then run the program by executing "python main.py"

Please find a working solution in "demo.txt"
